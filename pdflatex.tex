\thesislong{abstract}{	
	In a time where time is more precious than money it is crucial for people to accomplish a task as quick as possible. When creating various web-sites, the Kentico Enterprise Marketing Solution (KEMS) is a helpful tool to save time and therefore money. It is a content management system (CMS) which allows clients to create and manage their web-sites using a single user interface (UI). This thesis is about adding an extension to the said system which allows administrators to manage their site from their smartphones. The functionality implemented should reflect the basic needs of an administrator \linebreak[4]  of the KEMS. The extension consists of two parts: the custom web application programming interface (API) and the mobile application (app). The custom web API (CAPI) was leveraged to call the Kentico API (KAPI) and retrieve data and the mobile app was used as a gateway for the user and the CAPI.
