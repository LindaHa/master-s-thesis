\section{Future work}
The Leiden algorithm (LeA),  which is another algorithm for community detection on large graphs, might be used in the future instead of LA. The paper in which LeA is described claims LA has a major flaw which is eliminated in LeA. It needs to be taken into consideration if it becomes adopted widely. \cite{leidenAlgorithm}
