\section{Future work}
The Leiden algorithm (LeA) might be used in the future instead of LA. LeA is another algorithm for community detection on large graphs. The paper in which LeA is described claims LA has a major flaw which is eliminated in LeA \cite{leidenAlgorithm}. It needs to be taken into consideration if it becomes adopted widely.
