A part of this thesis was the categorization of the scraped pages. Categorization in this context means the process of assigning categories (labels) to pages. The data set at hand contained a vast amount of pages, as we discussed in chapter \ref{datasetAnalysis}. The manual categorization of this number of pages would therefore take too much time and in consequence was infeasible. An automatic system for text classification was required. A simple system with a list of words assigned to each label was introduced but was performing poorly. A more sophisticated tool for text categorization is machine learning. We decided to use supervised machine learning (ML).

This chapter describes ML. Secondly, supervised and unsupervised learning, types of machine learning, are characterized. Lastly, neural networks and their attributes detailed.
 
\section{Machine learning} \label{machineLearning}
The term \textit{machine learning} was first introduced by Arthur Samuel. In his paper \textit{Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the Game of Checkers} \cite{machineLearningOriginal} he proved it is possible for a program to develop better game-related skills than the skills of the programmer of the program.

ML is the process in which an application develops the ability to perform a certain task at least as well as a human would. The learning process is based on the evaluation of gained experience \cite{machineLearningToday}. The algorithm requires an initial data set in order to train and validate. The size of initial the data set depends on the nature of the task and the selected ML type. During training the algorithm attempts to perform the given task and validates its own performance. The algorithm then adjusts its criteria for performing the task based on the validation results. These two steps are repeated a number of times defined by the programmer. The output of the algorithm is a model able to perform the task it was trained for. There are several approaches in ML based on the different ways of training. We describe the three main approaches in the subsections following. Namely \textit{reinforcement learning} in subsection \ref{reinforcementLearning}, \textit{unsupervised learning} in subsection \ref{unsupervisedLearning}, and \textit{supervised learning} in subsection \ref{supervisedLearning}. The approach used in this thesis was \textit{supervised learning}. 

ML is a well researched and financed field because of the growing popularity of \textit{Big data}\footnote{} and the need to perform automated operations on the data. Another use-case for ML is the automotive industry, for example in self driving cars. Also, ML is used frequently in games.
